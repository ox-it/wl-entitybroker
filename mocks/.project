  <comment>The Sakai Entity Broker is an entity system for use in Sakai. Ideally we
        want flexible entities which make development of integrated Sakai tools easier and
        more flexible. Our goals are to make the entity system easier on developers
        (easier to use and understand) and more powerful (easier to extend and improve).
        The Entity Broker integrates seamlessly with the existing Entity system in Sakai
        (Entity Producers and Entities) and entities created using entity providers are
        accessible in Sakai as if they were created using the legacy system. Send feedback
        or comments to Aaron Zeckoski (azeckoski@gmail.com, aaronz@vt.edu)</comment>
